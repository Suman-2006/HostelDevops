# 🏨 HostelOps
## Production Deployment of a Containerized Complaint Management System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

HostelOps is a full-stack complaint management system designed to digitize hostel maintenance workflows.

The system allows students to:
- Register & Login
- Submit complaints (Category + Description + Priority)
- Track complaint status  

Administrators can:
- View all complaints
- Filter complaints by category or status
- Update complaint status  

This project focuses on **production-style DevOps deployment** using Docker containerization, Nginx reverse proxy configuration, and secure networking practices.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview
Client Browser
↓
Port 80 (Public)
↓
Nginx Reverse Proxy
↓
Backend Container (Node + Express)
↓
MongoDB Container

---

### Deployment Strategy

- Only **Port 80** is publicly exposed
- Backend (5000) is internal only
- MongoDB (27017) is internal only
- Nginx handles all incoming traffic
- API routes are securely proxied
- Environment variables configured externally
- Application is restart-safe

---

## 🐳 Running the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suman-2006/HostelDevops.git
cd HostelDevops
```

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
docker compose up
```

### 3. Access the Application
```bash
http://localhost
```

```

### 🔐 Networking & Security
Only Port 80 exposed publicly
Backend not directly accessible externally
MongoDB not exposed externally
Docker internal bridge network used
JWT-based authentication
Role-based access control
---

### Request Lifecycle Example:

When a student submits a complaint:
Browser sends HTTP request
Nginx receives request via Port 80
Nginx routes /api/* to backend container
Backend validates JWT
Backend processes logic
MongoDB stores or retrieves data
Response returns through Nginx
UI updates accordingly
---

### Architecture Type:

This project follows a Serverful Architecture because:
Infrastructure is manually managed
Docker containers are explicitly configured
Nginx reverse proxy is manually configured
Networking and port exposure are controlled by the developer

### Viewing the Project Documentation (PDF)

The final project documentation is included as:
hostelops.pdf
To open it inside VS Code:
Open VS Code
Go to Extensions
Install the extension:
```bash
vscode-pdf (by tomoki1207)
```
After installing, click on hostelops.pdf
It will open directly inside VS Code with proper PDF preview
-Without the extension, VS Code will show raw binary text.

### Final Note

HostelOps demonstrates a production-style full-stack deployment using modern DevOps principles, container orchestration, secure reverse proxy configuration, and structured networking practices.
